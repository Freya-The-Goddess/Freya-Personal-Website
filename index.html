    Hi, I'm Freya! I'm a 19 year old trans girl living in Melbourne, Victoria.
    </p>
    <h3 class="sectionHeading">Early Life &amp; Growing Up</h3>
    <p>
    I was born on the 6th of December 2000, and spent the first years of my life in a small home in South Melbourne near the market.
    When my first sister was born in 2002 we moved to a nice house with a large yard in Elwood, two blocks from the beach where the Point Ormond tram terminus once was.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was in this house that we spent most of our childhood years, with only a two years spent living in Sydney and Manley in NSW while our house was being renovated.
    The house was beautiful, and a place we called home, however it was not in a convinient location for public transport and was a considerable distance from school.
    So for most of my teenage years we rented a house in Brighton within walking distance from school and from Middle Brighton train station.

    <h3 class="sectionHeading">My Love of Trains</h3>
    <p>
    My love of trains started at a young age, getting excited seeing the train when we got stopped at a level crossing in my parent's car (unlike most people's frustration with getting stuck behind the boom gates).
    I also loved seeing the trams driving around on the streets, especially the herritage W class trams of the Route 35 City Circle, and the now out-of-service <em>Colonial Tramcar Restaurant</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    As I got older I relied more and more on <em>Metro</em>'s trains and <em>YarraTrams'</em> trams to travel places both for school and work, and for traveling to meet friends, and my love and interest for Trains and Trams grew.
    The more I rode the trains the more I started noticing the similarities and differences between the types of Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) <em>Metro</em> Trains, and researched about them out of curiosity, expanding also into Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) and Locomotive-hauled <em>V/Line</em> trains.
    While looking out the window, I also gained an appreciation and curiosity for the railway stations, as well as the tracks, infrastructure, and signalling of the railways.
    I was also lucky enough to be riding a train or at a station when a freight train passed through several times, which I also then researched to learn more about.
    </p>
    <p>
    My curiosity and research led to finding several Facebook groups dedicated to tracking freight and other interesting train movements throughout Victoria, of which I quickly became a member of.
    I learned through sources in the groups where to find timetables for the freight trains, and begun purposefully seeking them too at first just watch, then eventually to film them, beginning my hobby as a 'gunzel' (slang for railway fan).

    <p>
    Through the facebook groups I also learned about the heritage operators in Victoria. 
    There are quite a few isolated heritage railways throughout Victoria on formerly closed tracks that have been reclaimed, some running with steam locomotives, others with heritage diesel locomotives and railcars.
    However there are also a small handful of heritage operators with specisl permissions to be able to run tours on the mainlines and freight lines.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have ridden quite a few of these heritage tours since then, including riding several of the freight-only railway lines, passing and visiting some closed historic railway stations in various states of disrepair on lines that no longer serve passengers.
    I've since created somewhat of a bucket list spreadsheet of all the train lines in Victoria, including the freight only lines, heritage lines, and lines that closed, some torn up and are now rail trails.
    My goal is to ride as many of these train lines as possible, and for the lines that have closed, walk or bike ride along the alignment that the railway used to follow.

    A question I am often asked by people 'which is your favourite train line?', which although it is difficult to decide, I've rounded it down to my top 5 favourites:
    </p>
    <ol id="trainList">
        <li>
            <strong>Albion - Jacana freight line</strong><br/>
            This freight line connects Albion on the Sunbury line to Jacana on the Craigieburn line, and is the primary standard gauge freight route to NSW.
            Standard gauge <em>V/line</em> trains to Albury, and the <em>Sydney XPT</em> interstate train are the only regular passenger services that use this line.
            The line also has a lesser used broad gauge track which I have ridden on a heritage tour.
            Both Albion and Jacana have nice places beside the line a short walk from their respective <em>Metro</em> stations, where you can spot freight trains and the occasional Albury <em>V/line</em> and <em>Sydney XPT</em> without any fences or overhead power wires in the shot, and not have to worry about being blocked by a <em>Metro</em> train.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mornington Line</strong><br/>
            This closed passenger line originally branched off of the Stony Point Line at Baxter, heading towards the beach at Mornington.
            Nowadays the section of the line from Mooroduc to Mornington is in heritage use as the <em>'Mornington Railway'</em> with their steam locomotive K163.
            The tracks between Baxter and Moorooduc remain for the most part, although quite overgrown and the rails are in disrepair. The alignment is still owned by VicTrack and the line may one day be relaid and run passenger services.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sandringham Line</strong><br/>
            I grew up close to the Sandringham line and I've relied on it for most of my life to transport me. 
            It is a fairly short line, being only 18km long with 14 stations, It only takes about half an hour to get to the city.
            Victorian Railways once ran tram connections from Brighton Beach to St Kilda and from Sandringham to Black Rock, however not much evidence of these tram routes exist today.
            The old Sandringham tram depot is still visible from the railway platform of Sandringham Station across the yard, and the bus interchange outside the station still has its old tram shelter roof, and the road has a wide median where the tracked used to terminate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Geelong - Ballarat freight line</strong><br/>
            This broad gauge freight line used to operate as a passenger line, and there are still several heritage bluestone station buildings, most of which have been repurposed to buisnesses or private residences.
            The line swerves in between large grain fields and past silos, linking North Geelong to Ballarat.
            With the construction of the current direct Melbourne - Ballarat route, the longer route via Geelong fell out of favour and the line fell into freight use only, mostly to transport grain.
            I however have had the chance to ride on this line in a heritage train, which went to Ballarat via Geelong, before heading past Maryborough to the closed Dunolly station.
            A standard gauge line also branches off at Gheringhap to Ararat, which is part of The Overland's route.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>St Kilda Line (Route 96)</strong><br/>
            The St Kilda railway line ran from Flinders Street platform 11, across the Yarra River, and towards St Kilda past Albert Park.
            Due to the mostly industrial area at the time, the railway line was found to not be ecomonical running as a train service, however it was decided to convert it to light rail, regauging the line from broad gauge to standard gauge, and connecting it to Melbourne's existing tram system.
            It still operates today with low-floor trams as a segment of <em>YarraTrams</em> Route 96, with the old station buildings still in place and new lower platforms built.
            It was, for a short time, connected to the Sandringham (then Brighton) line from Windsor to connect it to the city, however this track was removed when the current route via Cremourne (Richmond) was constructed.
            'Windsor Sidings' is an interestingly shaped grassy park next to Windsor station where the connection to St Kilda once was.
            As mentioned above there was also once a tram operated by Victorian Railways from St Kilda to Brighton Beach. Not much remains of the tram route except a few tram shelters on Beach Road, and some roads that the route once followed being particularly wide, including one a block from my childhood home in Elwood.

    I recently rode on 'The Overland' service from Melbourne to Adelaide and back, as the SA government cut funding for the service at the start of 2020, and the Vic government funded the service for a limited time, but it has now ended.
    Especially with the outbreak of COVID-19 the future of the service is unknown, and I was lucky to ride one of the last runs of the service, as well as being able to tick it off my bucket list.
    It's an approximately 10hr train ride at an average of 90km/h, which we rode to Adelaide on a Saturday.
    On Sunday we checked out the <em>National Rail Museum</em> in Port Adelaide, and spent the day riding around the <em>Adelaide Metro</em> network and spotted one freight train.
    On Monday we got up early to catch our long train journey home, and it was while on the train that I recieved an email from <em>Swinburne</em> that classes were to move to online.
